# eg.py
# =====
#
# A very simple test engine inspired by Kent Beck's video: https://goo.gl/0bCy0X.
# Copyright (C) 2016, Tim Menzies BSD (2 clause).
#
# Usage
# -----        
#
# 1. Write many functions, each contain zero or more asserts.
# 2. Preface each such function with `@eg`
# 3. End file with `eg()`.
# 4. After that, then loading the file will run the examples.
#      -  This code catches any fails executions and, for each one, adds one to a
#         `FAIL` counter. Them at the end of the file, it reports the number of
#         functions that do not `FAIL`.
#      -  If a function contains a doco string, then that is printed before each
#         function is run.
#
# Example
#
#     # file = egdemo1.py
#     from eg import eg
#
#     @eg
#     def lstTest():
#       a={}
#       a[1]=10
#       assert a[1] == 10
#
#     # Other example functions here
#     
#     eg()
#
# Tips
# ----
#
# - `python egdemo1.py` will run all examples
# - `python egdemo1.py -?` will list all examples in the file.
# - `python egdemo1.py` -- a b c` will run just the examples `a`, `b` etc
#
# When I use this, then my code file file x.py has demos in (say) xeg.py whose
# first few lines are:
#
#        import x
#        from eg import eg
#
# To do
# -----
#
# Find some what to hook this into some continuous integration testing tool
# like https://travis-ci.org/.
