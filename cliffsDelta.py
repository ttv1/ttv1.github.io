# Notes
# -----
#
# This file includes a simple (and slow) version of cliffsDelta plus a trickier
# (and faster) one that takes advantage of sorted lists and repeated values.
#
# As shown by the sampel code at bottom...
#
# - both give the same results
# - when using pypy3, for lists less that 512 in size, there is little difference.
# - when using python, lsts on size 2n take twice as long with cdSimple than with cdTricky
#
# So, it is recomended that:
#
# - use pypy3;
# - use optimize (which is default, in the code).
#
# Reference
# ---------
#
# The following paper recommends that `trivial` be defined as follows:
#
# - small  = 0.147 (use this one to test that lists are different by more than a small effect)
# - medium = 0.33
# - large  = 0.474

# on the NSSE and other surveys: Are the t-test and Cohenâ€™sd indices the most appropriate
